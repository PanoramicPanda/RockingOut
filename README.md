# Rocking Out

A small repo for me to play around with the [Rockstar](https://github.com/RockstarLang/rockstar) specs in Ruby 
using the [Kaiser-Ruby](https://github.com/marcinruszkiewicz/kaiser-ruby) gem.

To run all of the `.rock` files in the `setlist` directory simply do the following:

```
bundler install
ruby rockout.rb
```

If you'd like to have the Rockstar printed out, along with the resulting Ruby code, use this instead:

```
ruby rockout.rb 'show-tabs'
```
